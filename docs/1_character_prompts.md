## iteration 1

[Fixed] Character DNA & Style Definition
A small, friendly cyber‑security detective mascot named "Alyac". Alyac is a chibi, capsule‑shaped character about 20 cm tall, designed in a clean 3D toy style. The upper half is a smooth mint‑green dome and the lower half is a smooth white capsule body, both made of soft matte plastic with gentle glossy highlights and perfectly rounded edges. The face has two small round black eyes, no nose, and a small curved mouth; the expression can change but the facial elements remain minimal and centered. Alyac has two short mint‑green arms with small rounded hands and no visible legs. Alyac wears no clothing. A bright yellow magnifying glass with a circular lens and a short handle is Alyac’s signature accessory and is always held in the right hand. The consistent color palette is mint‑green, white, bright yellow, and small black accents. Overall aesthetic: cheerful, approachable, and vigilant; modern minimal design; studio‑quality, soft diffused lighting and clean pastel surfaces.

A small, friendly cyber‑security detective mascot named "Alyac". Alyac is a chibi, capsule‑shaped character approximately 20 cm tall, designed in a clean 3D toy style.

- Physical form: a perfectly smooth capsule divided exactly at the midline; the upper half is a mint‑green dome, the lower half is a white capsule base. The lower half is a continuous rounded base with no legs or feet; Alyac stands upright on this unified base. Arms are short, mint‑green, and end in small rounded hands.
- Face: two small vertically oval black eyes, symmetrically spaced at mid‑height of the green dome, and a small centered curved mouth; no nose; facial features remain minimal and always centered.
- Materials and finish: soft matte plastic with muted, low‑intensity specular highlights; gentle beveled edges; clean, fingerprint‑free surface.
- Clothing: none.

## iteration 4

[Fixed] Character DNA & Style Definition (greener hue adjustment)
A small, friendly cyber‑security detective mascot named "Alyac". Keep all features from iteration 3. Only the color tone is refined to be slightly closer to green than yellow while staying soft and pastel.

- Color palette refinement: light pastel green for the head and arms that leans toward pure green rather than yellow. Exact target color reference: HEX #86D97F (approx. HSL 118°, 52%, 66%).

## iteration 5

[Fixed] Character DNA & Style Definition (round glossy eyes)
Keep all properties from iteration 4. Refine the face description for perfect circular eyes.

- Face refinement: the face consists only of two small perfectly round glossy black eyes and a small centered curved mouth. The eyes are bead‑like and uniformly circular (not oval), placed symmetrically at mid‑height of the dome, with a tiny white specular highlight on the upper‑right of each eye to suggest a soft sheen. The mouth remains minimal and centered. Overall expression can vary while keeping this minimal face layout.
